Neolink is a small program that acts as a proxy between Reolink IP cameras and
normal RTSP clients.
Certain cameras, such as the Reolink B800, do not implement ONVIF or RTSP, but
instead use a proprietary "Baichuan" protocol only compatible with their apps
and NVRs (any camera that uses "port 9000" will likely be using this protocol).
Neolink allows you to use NVR software such as Blue Iris, Frigate, or Shinobi to
receive video from these cameras instead.
The Reolink NVR is not required, and the cameras are unmodified.
Your NVR software connects to Neolink, which forwards the video stream from the
camera.

The Neolink project is not affiliated with Reolink in any way; everything it
does has been reverse engineered.

## This Fork

This is a maintained fork of
[MutuallyAssuredDeployment/neolink](https://github.com/MutuallyAssuredDeployment/neolink)
which itself is a fork of
[QuantumEntangledAndy/neolink](https://github.com/QuantumEntangledAndy/neolink),
which itself was a fork of
[thirtythreeforty/neolink](https://github.com/thirtythreeforty/neolink).

## Installation

Docker is the preferred way to run Neolink. Binary releases are not currently
provided.

### Docker (recommended)

Images are published to GHCR on every push to `master` and on tags:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/mutuallyassureddeployment/neolink:dev     # latest master
docker pull ghcr.io/mutuallyassureddeployment/neolink:latest   # latest tagged release
```

Run with:

```bash
docker run \
  --network host \
  --volume=$PWD/neolink.toml:/etc/neolink.toml \
  ghcr.io/mutuallyassureddeployment/neolink
```

> `--network host` is only needed for local broadcast discovery. If you connect
> via IP address, normal bridge mode works fine. macOS does not support
> `--network host`.

**Environment variables:**

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `NEO_LINK_MODE` | `rtsp` | Mode: `rtsp`, `mqtt`, or `mqtt-rtsp` |
| `NEO_LINK_PORT` | `8554` | RTSP listen port |

### Building from source

Requires Rust and GStreamer development libraries:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install \
  build-essential libssl-dev ca-certificates \
  libgstrtspserver-1.0-dev libgstreamer1.0-dev \
  libglib2.0-dev protobuf-compiler

cargo build --release
```

## Documentation

Detailed docs are in the [`docs/`](docs/) directory:

- [Configuration Reference](docs/configuration.md) — all config options, discovery, TLS, users, pause/idle
- [MQTT](docs/mqtt.md) — full message reference, Home Assistant discovery, runtime control
- [CLI Commands](docs/commands.md) — image capture, PTZ, talk, encoding, disk management
- [Setting Up with Blue Iris](docs/Setting%20Up%20Neolink%20For%20Use%20With%20Blue%20Iris.md)
- [Unix Service Setup](docs/unix_service.md)
- [Unix Build Setup](docs/unix_setup.md)

## Configuration

Create a `neolink.toml` file. See
[sample_config.toml](https://github.com/MutuallyAssuredDeployment/neolink/blob/master/sample_config.toml)
for all options.

Minimal example:

```toml
bind = "0.0.0.0"

[[cameras]]
name = "Camera01"
username = "admin"
password = "password"
uid = "ABCDEF0123456789"

[[cameras]]
name = "Camera02"
username = "admin"
password = "password"
address = "192.168.1.10:9000"
```

Start the RTSP server:

```bash
neolink rtsp --config=neolink.toml
```

Connect your NVR or RTSP client to:

```
rtsp://HOST:8554/CameraName
```

Where "CameraName" matches the `name` field in your config.

### Per-camera options

```toml
[[cameras]]
name = "Camera01"
username = "admin"
password = "password"
address = "192.168.1.10:9000"
stream = "mainStream"          # "mainStream", "subStream", or "both" (default)
enable_audio = true            # disable to save CPU (default: true)
enable_low_latency = false     # reduce stream delay (default: false)
discovery = "local"            # "local", "remote", "map", "relay", "cellular"
idle_disconnect = false        # disconnect when idle to save battery
debug = false                  # dump raw XML from camera
```

### Discovery

When connecting by UID, the camera IP is discovered with these methods (each
implicitly enables prior methods):

1. **local** — UDP broadcast on local network
2. **remote** — Ask Reolink servers for the IP, then connect directly
3. **map** — Register our IP with Reolink, camera connects to us
4. **relay** — Reolink relays the connection (neither side needs direct access)

Use `discovery = "cellular"` for cellular cameras (skips local/remote).

If you know the IP, set `address` directly and skip discovery entirely.

### MQTT

```toml
[mqtt]
broker_addr = "127.0.0.1"
port = 1883
credentials = ["username", "password"]
```

Start with MQTT + RTSP:

```bash
neolink mqtt-rtsp --config=neolink.toml
```

Or MQTT only:

```bash
neolink mqtt --config=neolink.toml
```

#### Messages

All messages are prefixed with `neolink/` or `neolink/{CAMERA_NAME}/`.

**Control** (`/control/...`): `led`, `ir`, `reboot`, `ptz`, `zoom`, `pir`,
`floodlight`, `floodlight_tasks`, `wakeup`, `siren`

**Status** (`/status/...`): `battery`, `battery_level`, `motion`, `pir`,
`ptz/preset`, `preview`, `floodlight_tasks`

**Query** (`/query/...`): `battery`, `pir`, `ptz/preset`, `preview`

See the
[sample config](https://github.com/MutuallyAssuredDeployment/neolink/blob/master/sample_config.toml)
for per-camera MQTT options (`enable_motion`, `enable_preview`,
`enable_battery`, etc.).

#### Home Assistant Discovery

```toml
[cameras.mqtt.discovery]
topic = "homeassistant"
features = ["floodlight", "camera", "led", "ir", "motion", "reboot", "pt", "battery", "siren"]
```

### Pause & Idle Disconnect

```toml
[cameras.pause]
on_motion = true    # pause when no motion
on_client = true    # pause when no RTSP client
timeout = 2.1       # seconds after motion stops before pausing
```

Add `idle_disconnect = true` to fully disconnect battery cameras when idle.

### Other Commands

```bash
neolink image    --config=neolink.toml --file-path=snap.jpg CameraName
neolink battery  --config=neolink.toml CameraName
neolink pir      --config=neolink.toml CameraName [on|off]
